Stock Icons Notes

80130E30   -> Pointer to Loaded File(s) from file 1
        -> at 0x348 of this file, pointer to stock image
          -> Pointer at 0x768 to 0x348 (does this go to image?)

Icon/Background seem to be stored as 2D image with typical SSB structure
In an included/req'ed file

Also it includes different pallets for character colors/costumes.

Are these the only things in the file...?
