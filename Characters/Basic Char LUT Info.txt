Char LUT
RAM	0x80116E10 
ROM	0x92610

pointers to active RAM structures

Struct

0x0
-
0x18	u32 file number


0x18
-
0x40	pointer to pointer to file
	except for the fifth word, 
	which looks like it points directly to the file...?
		(address in dynamically allocated RAM region)

Files obviously can include other files via reqs, etc.

Anyways, for mario (0x00)

LUT points to 0x80117810, which seems to be at 0x93010 uncompressed in ROM
So, substract (8)0084800 from the RAM pointers in the Char LUT to find ROM offsets 
for the character structs

Structs are pretty big, so there's probably important data in the structure itself, 
in addition to whatever is in the included files
